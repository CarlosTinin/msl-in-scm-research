### From 29/10/2024 to 05/11/2024

- Material review and construct a initial scaffold of the project.
	- Main elaboration, folder scaffold and Kevin's framework adaptation;
- Brief read in the files in Cases folder, that contextualize the topic.
- Using UFRGS email created account on Scopus and made a exploratory analysis.
- Classification of the recommended works in order of priority.
	- A special highlight to the reviews specially for [Modern Slavery In Supply Chain SLR](obsidian://open?vault=UFRGS-Vault&file=Research%2FPapers%2F00.%20Modern%20Slavery%20in%20Suply%20Chain%2FA%20systematic%20literature%20review%20of%20modern%20slavery%20in%20supply%20chain.pdf).
- Acquired topic keywords.

 1. *This SLR is a recent (dec/2023) synthesis of the current topic, how should we approach then?*
This systematic literature review is primarily related to the process of understanding, identifying and categorising modern slavery in SCM. It focus isn't the solutions built around the technologic tools like AI that aims to prevent and remedy this problem. 
### From 05/11/2024 to 09/11/2024 

 1. *Describe an updated framework, to understand the gaps and opportunities listed.*

The SLR can be used as guidance in the process of writing a review about the topic as well as conceiving insights about the categories and processes used in the past in the area.

 2. *Gather the references of this SLR and identify, which ones could be useful for this study.*

Gathered 4 references related to AI, machine learning, or digital technologies related to supply chain management (using ChatGPT).

3. *Regarding the Review structure:*

Found two works that will help to set up the initial elaboration:
- Conducting content‐analysis based literature reviews in supply chain management. (Stefan Seuring, Stefan Gold)
- From a literature review to a conceptual framework for sustainable supply chain management (Stefan Seuring, Martin Müller)

4. *Initial clustering works based on AI field of study.*
### From 05/11/2024 to 12/11/2024

1. *Search for more papers related to the topic preferring review papers.*
2. *Upload research resources in Github.*

### From 05/11/2024 to 12/11/2024

1. *Consolidate and Apply the framework studied to at least 5 works, initially.*
	a. *Adapt Kevin's structure to the classification framework described by Strand et al (2023).*

2. *Improving repository clustering based on common caracteristics.*
