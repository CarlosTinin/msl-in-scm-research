## 1. Identify Modern Slavery in Supply Chain
## 2. Intelligent uncovering of modern slavery in supply chain

The main focus of this study is to propose a methodological framework to identify modern slavery in supply chain. The project aims to develop a machine learning (ML) system for detecting and assessing risks of modern slavery within complex supply chains. This system seeks to identify and mitigate risks associated with forced labor, child labor, and other exploitative practices often hidden in global industries.

The SCM literature has largely focused on the definition provided by Gold et al. (2015), who defined modern slavery as: 

	"the exploitation of a person who is deprived of individual liberty anywhere along the supply chain from raw material extraction to the final customer for service provision or production” (p.5, Gold et al., 2015)."

Strand et al (2023) expands this previous definition in:

	"the recruitment and subsequent exploitation of a person (or a per- son in chattel or debt bondage slavery), who is deprived of their individual liberty anywhere along the product, human or labour supply chain to the final customer for service provision or production".
### Phase one: (Desired conclusion date: 30/11)

Seeking to understand the state of art in this topic and which techniques being used to detection, prevention, response and remedy. Leveraging on techniques already used in other surveys related to SCM ([Seuring and Müller, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095965260800111X); [Seuring and Gold, 2012](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/13598541211258609/full/html)) we can set our steps as:

(1) material collection 
- Define the criteria used for delimiting works.
- Describe the set of keywords or tags used and the selection process.
- State the resources databases used.
(2) descriptive analyses
- year in which the article was published, leveraging again in the SLR conducted by Strand et al (2023), with the following figure we can see the tendencies of publication of articles related to modern slavery in supply chain:![[Pasted image 20241109145221.png]]
- Journal, academic journal guide (AJG) and field. analyse how much articles about that topic was stated for each journal
- Industry settings that may be adapted to ai field
- Country
- Theories adopted in research on modern slavery in SCM

(3) category identification
- Thematic analysis: institutional factors, corporate stakeholders contexts, firm level, supply chain level, bussines-non-bussines stakeholders level...
(4) material evaluation
