|  [\[15](#[15])]  | Given the tremendous expected market growth, two different technologies have been standardized by international companies and consortia, namely IEEE 802.11p, out for nearly a decade, and short range cellular-vehicle-to-anything (C-V2X), of recent definition. Although studies have been conducted to highlight advantages and drawbacks of both, doubts still remain. In this work, with a reference to the literature and the aid of large scale simulations in realistic urban and highway scenarios, we provide an insight in such a comparison, also trying to isolate the contribution of the physical and medium access control layers. |     |

Abstract
	Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) is one of the enabling vehicular communication technologies gaining momentum from the standardization bodies, industry, and researchers aiming to realize fully autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standardization body has actively been developing the standards evolving from 4G-V2X to 5G-V2X providing ultra-reliable low-latency communications and higher throughput to deliver the solutions for advanced C-V2X services. In this survey, we analyze the 3GPP standard documents relevant to V2X communication to present the complete vision of 3GPP-enabled C-V2X. To better equip the readers with knowledge of the topic, we describe the underlying concepts and an overview of the evolution of 3GPP C-V2X standardization. Furthermore, we provide the details of the enabling concepts for V2X support by 3GPP. In this connection, we carry out an exhaustive study of the 3GPP standard documents and provide a logical taxonomy of C-V2X related 3GPP standard documents divided into three categories: 4G, 4G & 5G, and 5G based V2X services. We provide a detailed analysis of these categories discussing the system architecture, network support, key issues, and potential solution approaches supported by the 3GPP. We also highlight the gap and the need for intelligence in the execution of different operations to enable the use-case scenarios of Level-5 autonomous driving. We believe, the paper will equip readers to comprehend the technological standards for the delivery of different ITS services of the higher level of autonomous driving.

Abstract
	Recent advancements in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication have notably improved existing transport systems by enabling increased connectivity and driving autonomy levels. The remarkable benefits of V2X connectivity come inadvertently with challenges which involve security vulnerabilities and breaches. Addressing security concerns is essential for seamless and safe operation of mission-critical V2X use cases. This paper surveys current literature on V2X security and provides a systematic and comprehensive review of the most relevant security enhancements to date. An in-depth classification of V2X attacks is first performed according to key security and privacy requirements. Our methodology resumes with a taxonomy of security mechanisms based on their proactive/reactive defensive approach, which helps identify strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art countermeasures for V2X attacks. In addition, this paper delves into the potential of emerging security approaches leveraging artificial intelligence tools to meet security objectives. Promising data-driven solutions tailored to tackle security, privacy and trust issues are thoroughly discussed along with new threat vectors introduced inevitably by these enablers. The lessons learned from the detailed review of existing works are also compiled and highlighted. We conclude this survey with a structured synthesis of open challenges and future research directions to foster contributions in this prominent field.

Abstract
	With the continuous development of mobile communication technologies, Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has proposed related standards with the ﬁfth generation mobile communication technology (5G), which marks the ofﬁcial start of the evolution from the current Long Term Evolution (LTE) system to the next generation mobile communication system (5GS). This paper makes a large number of contributions to the security aspects of 3GPP 5G networks. Firstly, we present an overview of the network architecture and security functionality of the 3GPP 5G networks. Subsequently, we focus on the new features and techniques including the support of massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices, Device to Device (D2D) communication, Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communication, and network slice, which incur the huge challenges for the security aspects in 3GPP 5G networks. Finally, we discuss in detail the security features, security requirements or security vulnerabilities, existing security solutions and some open research issues about the new features and techniques in 3GPP 5G network.

Abstract
	Advances in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology and onboard sensors have significantly accelerated deploying Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). Integrating V2X with 5G has enabled Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) to CAVs. However, while communication performance has been enhanced, security and privacy issues have increased. Attacks have become more aggressive, and attackers have become more strategic. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) proposed by standardization bodies cannot solely defend against these attacks. Thus, in complementary of that, sophisticated systems should be designed to detect such attacks and attackers. Machine Learning (ML) has recently emerged as a key enabler to secure future roads. Various V2X Misbehavior Detection Systems (MDSs) have adopted this paradigm. However, analyzing these systems is a research gap, and developing effective ML-based MDSs is still an open issue. To this end, this paper comprehensively surveys and classifies ML-based MDSs as well as discusses and analyses them from security and ML perspectives. It also provides some learned lessons and recommendations for guiding the development, validation, and deployment of ML-based MDSs. Finally, this paper highlighted open research and standardization issues with some future directions

Abstract
	In its latest report, the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) registered some 37,300 fatalities for the yearly victims of motor vehicle accidents in 2017. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is playing an important role in improving road safety, traffic efficiency and [infotainment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/infotainment "Learn more about infotainment from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") systems. With the growth of the connected vehicle technology, V2X is emerging as a key component in the rapid rise of this technology. Therefore, researchers think that development of robust [wireless communication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/wireless-communication "Learn more about wireless communication from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") through efficient V2X technologies can significantly improve the [vehicular environment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vehicular-environment "Learn more about vehicular environment from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). The highly dynamic environment and the mobility factor appear to be challenging for implementation of V2X technology. Similar to other [wireless technology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/wireless-technologies "Learn more about wireless technology from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), the security issues are also key concerns in V2X. 
	In this survey, we highlight and discuss the main security issues of V2X. Particularly, the main objective of this survey is providing for a comprehensive and structured outline of different research directions and approaches, mostly emphasizing on the security issues and challenges in V2X communication technologies. At first, we discuss the key features of V2X and focus on the standardization techniques used for communication technologies. Then, we introduce the security challenges and requirements of V2X. We also classify present state-of-the-art works dealing with implementing different secured techniques in V2X. We further discuss the project implementation that concentrated on the various applications in V2X. Finally, we identify possible future research directions of V2X, particularly in the area of security.

Abstract
	In recent years, vehicles became able to establish connections with other vehicles and infrastructure units that are located in the [roadside](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/roadsides "Learn more about roadside from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). In the near future, the [vehicular network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vehicular-network "Learn more about vehicular network from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") will be expanded to include the communication between vehicles and any smart devices in the [roadside](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/roadsides "Learn more about roadside from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") which is called Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. The [vehicular network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vehicular-network "Learn more about vehicular network from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") causes many challenges due to heterogeneous nodes, various speeds and intermittent connection, where traditional security methods are not always efficacious. As a result, an extensive variety of research works has been done on optimizing security solutions whilst considering network requirements. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of the existing security solutions for V2X communication technology. Then, we provide discussions and comparisons with regard to some pertinent criteria. Also, we present a threat analysis for V2X enabling technologies. Finally, we point out the research challenges and some future directions.

Abstract
	In recent years, intelligent transportation systems, which provide safety and autonomous services on the road using the Internet and cellular technologies, have become increasingly important. Vehicles are equipped with sensors that can transmit data to other vehicles or infrastructure according to different types of services. In order to ensure robust connectivity for safety services, the transmission among vehicles requires low latency, high reliability, and high packet delivery ratio. With the increased number of vehicles, more frequency resources are needed to establish fast and reliable services. In the area of high vehicle density, the demand of frequency resources is increasing to establish stable connectivity in a short time. However, the amount of frequency resources is limited; the resource allocation scheme (RAS) should effectively assign a resource block to each user to ensure the quality of service. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of RASs for the 5G-based vehicular networks known as 5G V2X. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities for resource allocation in modern vehicular networks and present numerous promising future research directions.

Abstract
	5G technologies promise faster connections, lower latency, higher reliability, more capacity and wider coverage. We are looking to rely on these technologies to achieve Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, which increase the safety and autonomy of vehicles in addition to road safety, saving energy and costs. The integration of vehicular communication systems and 5G is the subject of many research. Nowadays, researchers address challenges such as automated and intelligent networks, cloud and edge data processing, network management, virtualization, security, privacy and finally interoperability. This paper provides a survey of the latest V2X use cases including requirements, and various 5G enabling technologies under consideration for vehicular communications. Subsequently, we first provide an interesting mapping between the three 5G pillars and V2X use case groups. Then, we present a summary of potential applications of enabling technologies for V2X use case groups. Finally, the open directions of research are discussed, and the challenges that await to be met are pointed out.

Abstract
	To enable large-scale and ubiquitous automotive network access, traditional vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies are evolving to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) for increasing demands on emerging advanced vehicular applications, such as intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and autonomous vehicles. In recent years, IoV technologies have been developed and achieved significant progress. However, it is still unclear what is the evolution path and what are the challenges and opportunities brought by IoV. For the aforementioned considerations, this article provides a thorough survey on the historical process and status quo of V2X technologies, as well as demonstration of emerging technology developing directions toward IoV. We first review the early stage when the dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) was issued as an important initial beginning and compared the cellular V2X with IEEE 802.11 V2X communications in terms of both the pros and cons. In addition, considering the advent of big data and cloud-edge regime, we highlight the key technical challenges and pinpoint the opportunities toward the big data-driven IoV and cloud-based IoV, respectively. We believe our comprehensive survey on evolutionary V2X technologies toward IoV can provide beneficial insights and inspirations for both academia and the IoV industry.

Abstract
	As we edge closer to the broad implementation of intelligent transportation systems, the need to extend the perceptual bounds of sensor-equipped vehicles beyond the individual vehicle is more pressing than ever. Research and standardization efforts toward vehicle to everything (V2X), technology is intended to enable the communication of individual vehicles with both one another and supporting road infrastructure. The topic has drawn interest from a large number of stakeholders, from governmental authorities to automotive manufacturers and mobile network operators. With interest sourced from many disparate parties and a wealth of research on a large number of topics, trying to grasp the bigger picture of V2X development can be a daunting task. In this tutorial survey, to the best of our knowledge, we collate research across a number of topics in V2X, from historical developments to standardization activities and a high-level view of research in a number of important fields. In so doing, we hope to provide a useful reference for the state of V2X research and development for newcomers and veterans alike.

The [Long Term Evolution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/long-term-evolution "Learn more about Long Term Evolution from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (LTE) network and the emerging 5G system (New Radio) are widely acknowledged as the main driving forces for the connected-vehicle in the mobile network domain. On the other hand, [vehicular networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vehicular-network "Learn more about vehicular networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") are characterised by high mobility, high node density, dynamic [network topology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/network-topology "Learn more about network topology from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), time sensitivity and high transmission reliability. These unique characteristics of [vehicular networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vehicular-network "Learn more about vehicular networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") introduce new security implications and therefore, necessitate enhancement of existing LTE security or provision of new security techniques, in order to ensure fast, secure and reliable [vehicular communications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vehicular-communication "Learn more about vehicular communications from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") under mobile network. In this paper, an introduction to Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communications and services alongside the corresponding service requirement is presented. Then, the potential benefits of using [cellular infrastructure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cellular-infrastructure "Learn more about cellular infrastructure from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") for V2X services and the reference architectures for cellular-based V2X systems are described. We then focus on the security requirements of V2X in [cellular network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/cellular-network "Learn more about cellular network from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), specifically; on the authentication of V2X entities, as any violation or breach of [authentication process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/authentication-process "Learn more about authentication process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") can expose the entire network to serious consequences. The paper discusses common V2X threats and surveys existing V2X authentication solutions proposed in the literature. Finally, paper presents security issues related to V2X communication in cellular network leading towards possible research challenges.

Abstract
	Connected and fully automated vehicles are expected to revolutionize our mobility in the near future on a global scale, by significantly improving road safety, traffic efficiency, and traveling experience. Enhanced vehicular applications, such as cooperative sensing and maneuvering or vehicle platooning, heavily rely on direct connectivity among vehicles, which is enabled by sidelink communications. In order to set the ground for the core contribution of this paper, we first analyze the main streams of the cellular-vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) technology evolution within the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), with focus on the sidelink air interface. Then, we provide a comprehensive survey of the related literature, which is classified and critically dissected, considering both the Long-Term Evolution-based solutions and the 5G New Radio-based latest advancements that promise substantial improvements in terms of latency and reliability. The wide literature review is used as a basis to finally identify further challenges and perspectives, which may shape the C-V2X sidelink developments in the next-generation vehicles beyond 5G.

Abstract
	Vehicle to everything (V2X) is a new generation of information and communication technologies that connect vehicles to everything. It not only creates a more comfortable and safer transportation environment, but also has much significance for improving traffic efficiency, and reducing pollution and accident rates. At present, the technology is still in the exploratory stage, and the problems of traffic safety and information security brought about by V2X applications have not yet been fully evaluated. Prior to marketization, we must ensure the reliability and maturity of the technology, which must be rigorously tested and verified. Therefore, testing is an important part of V2X technology. This article focuses on the V2X application requirements and its challenges, the need of testing. Then we also investigate and summarize the testing methods for V2X in the communication process and describe them in detail from the architectural perspective. In addition, we have proposed an end-to-end testing system combining virtual and real environments which can undertake the test task of the full protocol stack.

Abstract
	Vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communications refer to information exchange between a vehicle and various elements of the intelligent transportation system (ITS), including other vehicles, pedestrians, Internet gateways, and transport infrastructure (such as traffic lights and signs). The technology has a great potential of enabling a variety of novel applications for road safety, passenger infotainment, car manufacturer services, and vehicle traffic optimization. Today, V2X communications is based on one of two main technologies: dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) and cellular networks. However, in the near future, it is not expected that a single technology can support such a variety of expected V2X applications for a large number of vehicles. Hence, interworking between DSRC and cellular network technologies for efficient V2X communications is proposed. This paper surveys potential DSRC and cellular interworking solutions for efficient V2X communications. First, we highlight the limitations of each technology in supporting V2X applications. Then, we review potential DSRC-cellular hybrid architectures, together with the main interworking challenges resulting from vehicle mobility, such as vertical handover and network selection issues. In addition, we provide an overview of the global DSRC standards, the existing V2X research and development platforms, and the V2X products already adopted and deployed in vehicles by car manufactures, as an attempt to align academic research with automotive industrial activities. Finally, we suggest some open research issues for future V2X communications based on the interworking of DSRC and cellular network technologies.

Abstract
	The revolution of cooperative connected and automated vehicles is about to begin and a key milestone is the introduction of short range wireless communications between cars. Given the tremendous expected market growth, two different technologies have been standardized by international companies and consortia, namely IEEE 802.11p, out for nearly a decade, and short range cellular-vehicle-to-anything (C-V2X), of recent definition. In both cases, evolutions are under discussion. The former is only decentralized and based on a sensing before transmitting access, while the latter is based on orthogonal resources that can be also managed by an infrastructure. Although studies have been conducted to highlight advantages and drawbacks of both, doubts still remain. In this work, with a reference to the literature and the aid of large scale simulations in realistic urban and highway scenarios, we provide an insight in such a comparison, also trying to isolate the contribution of the physical and medium access control layers.

Abstract
	In recent studies, vehicular networks have been considered as a promising solution to achieve better traffic management and to improve the driving experience of drivers. In vehicular networks, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services, e.g. on-road traffic information exchange and location-based services, are provided to facilitate road safety for vehicles and traffic management for the relevant authorities. Dedicated Short Range Communications is specifically designed for V2X communications, and recently the cellular network has shown great potential to support V2X with better performance and more applications. Due to the wireless nature of V2X communications, how to secure V2X communications and guarantee the privacy of users are great challenges that have hampered the implementation of vehicular services. Many solutions have been proposed by researchers in last two decades. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art solutions concerning security and privacy for V2X communications. For security, detailed discussions on cryptography based schemes and trust based schemes are provided. For privacy, we summarize and compare general solutions in preserving identity privacy and location privacy. Cellular based V2X communications have shown many advantages over DSRC, and the oncoming fifth-generation cellular technology is going to provide more possibilities to V2X. Thus, security architectures and solutions for cellular based communications are also illustrated and discussed. Finally, we summarize the remaining challenges and point out future research directions.

Abstract
	In mobile environments, with the help of larger bandwidths and cloud computing solutions, any task can be offloaded from a mobile user equipment to be handled remotely. However, even though this process is accelerated with every cellular generation, with 5G being no exception, offloading to a faraway centralized cloud implies non-negligible delay. To tackle this issue concerning delay-sensitive applications, [mobile edge computing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/multi-access-edge-computing "Learn more about mobile edge computing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), now denominated as multi-access edge computing (MEC), was brought to light. With cloud resources brought closer to the edge of the network, MEC greatly reduces task offloading delay, thereby striving to satisfy the constraints of real-time applications. As highly demanding mobile applications, [vehicular networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vehicular-network "Learn more about vehicular networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") are a target to be addressed in terms of performance, especially communication and computation delay. In this article, we establish the specificities of MEC when applied to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and survey recent papers studying implementations of MEC relevant to real-time vehicular considerations. We categorize these latest V2X architectures so as to unveil the mechanisms behind their improved performance: network availability and coverage, reliability and loss of network connectivity, large [data handling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/data-analysis "Learn more about data handling from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and task offloading. This survey not only provides an initial understanding of the state-of-the-art advancements in the field of MEC-enabled [vehicular networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vehicular-network "Learn more about vehicular networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), but also raises open issues and challenges that need to be addressed before enjoying the full benefits of this paradigm.

Abstract
	Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication is receiving growing attention from industry and academia as multiple pilot projects explore its capabilities and feasibility. With about 50% of global road vehicle exports coming from the European Union (EU), and within the context of EU legislation around security and data protection, V2X initiatives must consider security and privacy aspects across the system stack, in addition to road safety. Contrary to this principle, our survey of relevant standards, research outputs, and EU pilot projects indicates otherwise; we identify multiple security- and privacy-related shortcomings and inconsistencies across the standards. We conduct a root cause analysis of the reasons and difficulties associated with these gaps, and categorize the identified security and privacy issues relative to these root causes. As a result, our comprehensive analysis sheds lights on a number of areas that require improvements in the standards, which are not explicitly identified in related work. Our analysis fills gaps left by other related surveys, which are focused on specific technical areas but do not necessarily point out underlying root issues in standard specifications. We bring forward recommendations to address these gaps for the overall improvement of security and safety in vehicular communication.

Abstract
	Smart cities are ecosystems where novel ideas and emerging technologies meet to improve economy, environment, governance, living, and mobility. One of the pillars of smart cities is transport, with the improvement of mobility and the reduction of traffic accidents being some of the current key challenges. With this purpose, this manuscript reviews the state-of-the-art of communications and applications in which different actors of the road are involved. Thus, the objectives of this survey are intended to determine who, when, and about what is being researched around smart cities. Particularly, the goal is to situate the focus of scientific and industrial progress on V2X, I2X, and P2X communication to establish a taxonomy that reduces ambiguous acronyms around the communication between vehicles, infrastructure, and pedestrians, as well as to determine what the trends and future technologies are that will lead to more powerful applications. To this end, this literature review article presents a comprehensive study including a representative collection of the 100 most cited papers and patents published in the literature together with a statistical bibliometric analysis of 14,364 keywords over 3422 contributions between 1997 and 2018. As a result, this work provides a technological profile considering different dimensions along the paper, such as the type of communication, use case, country, organization, terminology, and year.

Abstract
	Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) have become increasingly popular because they support effective coordination in connected vehicles. ITSs present an integrated approach for exchanging relevant information in order to improve the safety, efficiency, and reliability of road transportation systems. A variant of mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) called vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are an integral component of ITSs. VANETs consist of interconnected vehicles with sensing abilities that exchange information related to traffic, positioning, weather, and emergency services. In general, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) refers to communications between any entity and a vehicle, where the entity may be a vehicle, a cloud-based network, a pedestrian, or equipment installed along a road. One of the crucial challenges in V2X is the reliable and timely circulation of information among vehicular nodes to allow drivers to make decisions that increase road safety. In this context, efficient V2X routing protocols play a key role in supporting reliability and safety, and enhancing the overall quality of service (QoS) in VANETs. However, VANETs have distinct characteristics, such as high vehicular node mobility, unsteady connectivity, rapid changes in network topology, and unbounded network size, that can significantly affect routing in the network. Various routing protocols for V2X communication exist in the open technical literature. In this survey, we categorize the routing mechanisms as non-learning- and learning-based approaches, and discuss existing V2X routing protocols and their contributions to and impacts on VANET performance. Here, the learning-based approach implies the use of machine learning algorithms. This survey also summarizes open challenges in designing effective V2X routing protocols and future research directions to consider when developing smart routing mechanisms for next-generation intelligent VANET technologies.

Abstract
	Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is continuously evolving alongside communication technologies and autonomous driving, giving way to new applications and services. Considering the significant rise in traffic casualties, protecting vulnerable road users (VRU), such as pedestrians, cyclists, motorcycles, animals, etc., has become ever more critical. That said, technological advances alone can not meet the requirements of such crucial applications. Therefore, combining them with architectural revolutions, particularly cloud, fog, and edge computing, is essential. In this review, we scrutinize the VRU safety application with regard to technological evolution. This review establishes the foundations for designing resilient, more reliable, end-to-end VRU protection services. It illustrates the possibility of combining the performance of different technologies through exploiting 5G architectural advantages (function placement, direct/indirect communication, etc.) for the intended application. In the context of 5G architecture, collision avoidance systems consider network and application-related challenges and solutions. This survey provides standardization, studies, and project efforts related to the use case and considers the different types of messages in the V2VRU communication-based safety application. We investigate how adapting the application parameters to the network state and devices’ available resources can use network resources efficiently and provide reliable services.

Abstract
	Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication systems have an eminence potential to improve road safety and optimize traffic flow by broadcasting Basic Safety Messages (BSMs). Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) and LTE Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) are two candidate technologies to enable V2V communication. DSRC relies on the IEEE 802.11p standard for its PHY and MAC layer while LTE-V2X is based on 3GPP’s Release 14 and operates in a distributed manner in the absence of cellular infrastructure. There has been considerable debate over the relative advantages and disadvantages of DSRC and LTE-V2X, aiming to answer the fundamental question of which technology is most effective in real-world scenarios for various road safety and traffic efficiency applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these two technologies (i.e., DSRC and LTE-V2X) and related works. More specifically, we study the PHY and MAC layer of both technologies in the survey study and compare the PHY layer performance using a variety of field tests. First, we provide a summary of each technology and highlight the limitations of each in supporting V2X applications. Then, we examine their performance based on different metrics.

Abstract
	Vehicular networks, an enabling technology for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), smart cities, and autonomous driving, can deliver numerous on-board data services, e.g., road-safety, easy navigation, traffic efficiency, comfort driving, infotainment, etc. Providing satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS) in vehicular networks, however, is a challenging task due to a number of limiting factors such as erroneous and congested wireless channels (due to high mobility or uncoordinated channel-access), increasingly fragmented and congested spectrum, hardware imperfections, and anticipated growth of vehicular communication devices. Therefore, it will be critical to allocate and utilize the available wireless network resources in an ultra-efficient manner. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on resource allocation schemes for the two dominant vehicular network technologies, e.g. Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) and cellular based vehicular networks. We discuss the challenges and opportunities for resource allocations in modern vehicular networks and outline a number of promising future research directions.

Abstract
	The main goal behind radio resource management (RRM), in any conventional wireless networks, is to efficiently utilize the available resources. Critical and safety communications have very stringent quality of service requirements on reliability and availability. Consequently, the efficient use of resources becomes more compelling when it deals with this type of application. In this context, cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communications, enabled by cellular device-to-device (D2D), have recently drawn much attention. This is due to their applicability to road safety and traffic efficiency applications, which require information exchange among road users and road-side entities. This emerging technology, referred hereinafter as LTE-V or C-V2X, supports two different communication modes: 3 and 4. Both of the two modes enable direct vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications via PC5 interface. However, they differ on how the radio resources are allocated. Several approaches and algorithms are proposed in the literature to address the resource allocation issue. In this paper, a state of the art of the radio resource allocation strategies was made for LTE-V technology and a qualitative description was carried out of these different schemes. We proposed a classification of these strategies into different categories. This classification identified the different strengths and weaknesses of each proposal. Up to our knowledge, several surveys concerning resource allocation are published in the context of LTE but very few of them focuses on both RRM and vehicular networks.

Abstract
	As 5G communication technology develops, vehicular communications that require high reliability, low latency, and massive connectivity are drawing increasing interest from those in academia and industry. Due to these developing technologies, vehicular communication is not limited to vehicle components in the forms of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) or Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) networks, but has also been extended to connect with others, such as pedestrians and cellular users. Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) is the conventional vehicular communication standard for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). More recently, the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project introduced Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X), a competitor to DSRC. Meanwhile, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to consider deploying Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII) devices in the ITS band with two interference mitigation approaches: Detect-and-Vacate (DAV) and Re-channelization (Re-CH). With multiple standard options and interference mitigation approaches, numerous regulatory taxonomies can be identified and notification of relevant technical challenges issued. However, these challenges are much broader than the current and future regulatory taxonomies pursued by the different countries involved. Because their plans differ, the technical and regulatory challenges vary. This article presents a literature survey about the technical challenges, the current and future ITS band usage plans, and the major research testbeds for the U.S., Europe, China, Korea, and Japan. This survey shows that the most likely deployment taxonomies are (1) DSRC, C-V2X, and Wi-Fi with Re-CH; (2) DSRC and C-V2X with interoperation, and (3) C-V2X only. The most difficult technical challenge is the interoperability between the Wi-Fi-like DSRC and 4G LTE-like C-V2X.

Abstract
	Next-generation vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks are envisioned as communication platforms, which not only aim to improve road safety and drastically increase traffic efficiency but also introduce a plethora of innovative applications that mostly require ultrareliable low-latency communications. Motivated by such new applications and its accompanying services, future vehicular networks can easily switch from current connected vehicles, mostly vehicle-to-vehicle, to fully heterogeneous V2X networks that support autonomous driving. Toward this target, the deep integration between artificial intelligence (AI) and fog computing (FC) technologies within the future V2X networks is a step whose time has come. In this survey, we address a novel and practical AI-enabled vehicular network architecture with FC in its core. Moreover, we present AI-enabled, fog-assisted V2X use cases that accommodate important FC capabilities and exploit the power of AI for enabling the desired evolution of vehicular networks. Finally, some potential issues of AI in FC-based V2X networks for future work are discussed.

Abstract
	The Department of Transport in the United Kingdom recorded 25,080 motor vehicle fatalities in 2019. This situation stresses the need for an intelligent transport system (ITS) that improves road safety and security by avoiding human errors with the use of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Therefore, this survey discusses the current development of two main components of an ITS: (1) gathering of AVs surrounding data using sensors; and (2) enabling vehicular communication technologies. First, the paper discusses various sensors and their role in AVs. Then, various communication technologies for AVs to facilitate vehicle to everything (V2X) communication are discussed. Based on the transmission range, these technologies are grouped into three main categories: long-range, medium-range and short-range. The short-range group presents the development of Bluetooth, ZigBee and ultra-wide band communication for AVs. The medium-range examines the properties of dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). Finally, the long-range group presents the cellular-vehicle to everything (C-V2X) and 5G-new radio (5G-NR). An important characteristic which differentiates each category and its suitable application is latency. This research presents a comprehensive study of AV technologies and identifies the main advantages, disadvantages, and challenges.

Abstract
	With the accelerating industrialization of 5G-V2X and smart automobiles, the intelligent connected vehicle (ICV) integrated with sophisticated communication, caching, computing, and control techniques enhance the functionality of in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) and also provide more powerful telematic or entertainment choices in vehicular environment. The diverse needs of ICV users (e.g., drivers and passengers) can be satisfied during commuting and traveling. However, considering the limitations of transportation environment, the potential attitude and usage behavior for the upcoming ICV infotainment directly impacts on the traffic and road safety in sustainable cities. In this paper, we conduct an online and offline survey to investigate the key factors influencing the user attitude and intention of ICV infotainment, where the answers of a total of 502 valid respondents (i.e., IVI users) are collected in China. A conceptual technology acceptance model with the constructs of perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), social influence (SI), consumer innovation (CI), and perceived risk (PR) is established, and then assessed via partial least square structural equation modeling. We find that the constructs of PU, PEOU, CI, and SI have a direct impact on attitude and usage intention, of which 46.8% and 73.4% of variance, respectively, are explained. The respondents show positive attitudes and higher usage intention towards the ICV infotainment. Although PR has insignificant path with attitude and intention, the driving experience moderation effect exists between PR and usage intention. We can see that ICV infotainment will become a trend in future transportation scenario.

Abstract
	In modern decentralized cellular-vehicle-to-anything (C-V2X) infrastructures, connected autonomous smart vehicles (CASVs) exchange vehicular information with peer CASVs. To leverage responsive communication, sensors deployed in CASVs communicate through responsive edge computing (REC) infrastructures to support device-to-device- (D2D) based communication. To support low-latency, high-bandwidth, dense mobility, and high availability, researchers worldwide have proposed efficient 5G REC infrastructures to end vehicular users (VU). However, with the growing number of sensor units, intelligent automation, dense sensor integration at massive ultra-low latency is required. To address the issue, the focus has shifted toward sixth-generation (6G)-based intelligent C-V2X orchestration. However, the sensor data is exchanged through open channels, and thus trust and privacy among C-V2X nodes is a prime concern. Thus, blockchain (BC) is a potential solution to allow immutable exchange ledgers among CASV sensor units for secure data exchange. With this motivation, the proposed survey integrates BC and 6G-leveraged REC in C-V2X to address the issues of fifth-generation (5G)-REC through immutable, verified, and chronological timestamped data exchanged through 6G-envisioned terahertz (THz) channels, at high mobility, extremely low latency, and high availability. The survey also presents the open issues and research challenges in the 6G-envisioned BC-enabled REC C-V2X ecosystems via a proposed framework. A case study 6Edge is presented for smart 6G intelligent edge integration with BC-based ledgers. Finally, the concluding remarks and future direction of research are proposed. Thus, the proposed survey forms a guideline for automotive stakeholders, academicians, and researchers to explore the various opportunities of the possible integration in more significant detail.

Abstract
	Vehicles will soon be connected and will be interacting directly with each other and with the road infrastructure, bringing substantial benefits in terms of safety and traffic efficiency. The past decade has seen the development of different wireless access technologies for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications and an extensive set of related use cases have been drafted, each with its own requirements. In this paper, focusing on short-range communications, we analyze the technical and economic motivations that are driving the development of new road users’ connectivity, discussing the international intentions to mandate on board devices for V2X communication. We also go in depth with the enabling wireless access technologies, from IEEE 802.11p to short-range Cellular-V2X and other complementary technologies, such as visible light communication (VLC) and millimeterWaves, up to hybrid communication and 5G. We conclude our survey with some performance comparison in urban realistic scenarios, underlying that the choice of the future enabling technology is not so easy to predict and mostly depends on mandatory laws at the international level.

Abstract
	With the rising interest in autonomous vehicles, developing radio access technologies (RATs) that enable reliable and low-latency vehicular communications has become of paramount importance. Dedicated short-range communications (DSRCs) and cellular V2X (C-V2X) are two present-day technologies that are capable of supporting day-1 vehicular applications. However, these RATs fall short of supporting communication requirements of many advanced vehicular applications, which are believed to be critical in enabling fully autonomous vehicles. Both the DSRC and C-V2X are undergoing extensive enhancements in order to support advanced vehicular applications that are characterized by high reliability, low latency, and high throughput requirements. These RAT evolutions—the IEEE 802.11bd for the DSRC and NR V2X for C-V2X—can supplement today’s vehicular sensors in enabling autonomous driving. In this paper, we survey the latest developments in the standardization of 802.11bd and NR V2X. We begin with a brief description of the two present-day vehicular RATs. In doing so, we highlight their inability to guarantee the quality of service requirements of many advanced vehicular applications. We then look at the two RAT evolutions, i.e., the IEEE 802.11bd and NR V2X, outline their objectives, describe their salient features, and provide an in-depth description of key mechanisms that enable these features. While both, the IEEE 802.11bd and NR V2X, are in their initial stages of development, we shed light on their preliminary performance projections and compare and contrast the two evolutionary RATs with their respective predecessors.

Abstract
	5G is emerging to serve as a platform to support networking connections for sensors and vehicles on roads and provide vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services to drivers and pedestrians. 5G V2X communication brings tremendous benefits to us, including improved safety, high reliability, large communication coverage, and low service latency. On the other hand, due to ubiquitous network connectivity, it also presents serious trust, security, and privacy issues toward vehicles, which may impede the success of 5G V2X. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on the security of 5G V2X services. Specifically, we first review the architecture and the use cases of 5G V2X. We also study a series of trust, security, and privacy issues in 5G V2X services and discuss the potential attacks on trust, security, and privacy in 5G V2X. Then, we offer an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art strategies for securing 5G V2X services and elaborate on how to achieve the trust, security, or privacy protection in each strategy. Finally, by pointing out several future research directions, it is expected to draw more attention and efforts into the emerging 5G V2X services.

Abstract
	Cooperative perception, as a critical technology of intelligent connected vehicles, aims to use wireless communication technology to interact and fuse environmental information obtained by edge nodes with local perception information, which can improve vehicle perception accuracy, reduce latency, and eliminate perception blind spots. It has become a current research hotspot. Based on the analysis of the related literature on the Internet of vehicles (IoV), this paper summarizes the multi-sensor information fusion method, information sharing strategy, and communication technology of autonomous driving cooperative perception technology in the IoV environment. Firstly, cooperative perception information fusion methods, such as image fusion, point cloud fusion, and image–point cloud fusion, are summarized and compared according to the approaches of sensor information fusion. Secondly, recent research on communication technology and the sharing strategies of cooperative perception technology is summarized and analyzed in detail. Simultaneously, combined with the practical application of V2X, the influence of network communication performance on cooperative perception is analyzed, considering factors such as latency, packet loss rate, and channel congestion, and the existing research methods are discussed. Finally, based on the summary and analysis of the above studies, future research issues on cooperative perception are proposed, and the development trend of cooperative perception technology is forecast to help researchers in this field quickly understand the research status, hotspots, and prospects of cooperative perception technology.

Abstract
	To enable next-generation connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), the future Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) network is expected to provide centimeter-accurate localization service while attaining low-latency transmissions in high-mobility environments. Nevertheless, these unprecedented requirements are far beyond the capabilities of 5G vehicular networks. Given the above evolution trend, a natural idea is thus to design a joint system architecture that combines both communications and sensing subsystems. To this end, research efforts toward integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) for the V2X network are well underway. It is our belief that ISAC should facilitate both sensing and communication via a single system in a spectrum-/energy-/cost-efficient way. Moreover, it can also improve the performance of both functionalities with mutual assistance, which is also essential to enable CAV's mission-critical services for 6G and beyond V2X. In this article, we first provide a brief historical overview of V2X and ISAC. In particular, we analyze the forces driving the usage of ISAC in V2X. Then we introduce three ISAC design schemes based on their underlying systems. We also survey state-of-the-art enabling technologies by reviewing recent developments of ISAC-assisted beamforming technologies in vehicular networks. Finally, we shed light on some potential challenges and research directions.

Abstract
	The vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications, as enabled by cellular device-to-device (D2D) links, has recently gained greater attention owing to the remarkable capacity it displays in enhancing traffic safety, effectiveness, and comfort. It is in this context that the present paper can be set, whereby a new technology is advanced, relating to the fifth generation (5G) associated D2D based vehicular communication, as lately approved by the 3GPP standardization community. In effect, V2X communication appears to raise a number of critical issues that are closely inter-related, mainly, those attached to stringent latency and reliability requirements. In this respect, an exhaustive investigation of the state of the art is put forward D2D based vehicular communication is detailed, throughout the scope of the present work. In the first place, a thorough examination of the D2D associated works, treating such a study area from different perspectives, is displayed. In a second place, the major reason lying behind the application of the D2D communication for vehicular service purposes, involving the possibilities it provides, along with the expected prospective potentials, it could offer, are investigated. In addition, a special emphasis is laid on the particular restrictions associated with the implementation of the V2X Radio Resource Management problem formulation. In a last step, and on reviewing a number of papers dealing with the area of D2D based vehicular communication, some disciplines that do not see to have been satisfactorily and exhaustively elaborated are depicted, while highlighting potential work associated challenges, mainly concerning the D2D effective integration for vehicular communication purposes.

Abstract
	[Vehicular networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vehicular-network "Learn more about Vehicular networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") are on the verge of deployment, thanks to the advancements in computation and communication technologies. This breed of ad [hoc networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/hoc-network "Learn more about hoc networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") leverages vehicles as nodes with Vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication paradigm. Clustering is considered one of the most important techniques used to enhance network stability, reliability, and scalability. Furthermore, clustering employs bandwidth optimization by reducing the overhead and transmission delay and helps in mitigating the [hidden node problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/hidden-node-problem "Learn more about hidden node problem from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). To date, extensive research has been done to address clustering issues in vehicular networks, and several surveys have also been published in the literature. However, a holistic approach towards clustering in vehicular networks is still lacking. In this regard, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the recent advancements in the [clustering schemes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/clustering-scheme "Learn more about clustering schemes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") for vehicular networks. We take a holistic approach to classify the algorithms by focusing on, (i) the objective of clustering mechanisms (i.e., reliability, scalability, stability, routing overhead, and delay), (ii) general-purpose [clustering algorithms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/clustering-algorithm "Learn more about clustering algorithms from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), (iii) application-based (i.e., QoS, MAC, security, etc.) clustering, and iv) technology-based clustering (machine learning-based, nature-inspired, fuzzy logic-based and software-defined networking-based clustering). We investigate the existing clustering mechanisms keeping in mind the factors such as cluster formation, maintenance, and management. Additionally, we present a comprehensive set of parameters for selecting cluster heads and the role of enabling technologies for cluster maintenance. Finally, we identify future research trends in [clustering techniques](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/clustering-technique "Learn more about clustering techniques from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") for vehicular networks and their various breeds. This survey will act as a one-stop shop for the researchers, practitioners, and system designers to select the right clustering mechanism for their applications, services, or for their research. As a result of this survey, we can see that clustering is heavily dependent on the underlying application, context, environment, and communication paradigm. Furthermore, clustering in vehicular networks can greatly benefit from enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence.

Abstract
	Safety is the most important requirement for autonomous vehicles; hence, the ultimate challenge of designing an edge computing ecosystem for autonomous vehicles is to deliver enough computing power, redundancy, and security so as to guarantee the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, autonomous driving systems are extremely complex; they tightly integrate many technologies, including sensing, localization, perception, decision making, as well as the smooth interactions with cloud platforms for high-definition (HD) map generation and data storage. These complexities impose numerous challenges for the design of autonomous driving edge computing systems. First, edge computing systems for autonomous driving need to process an enormous amount of data in real time, and often the incoming data from different sensors are highly heterogeneous. Since autonomous driving edge computing systems are mobile, they often have very strict energy consumption restrictions. Thus, it is imperative to deliver sufficient computing power with reasonable energy consumption, to guarantee the safety of autonomous vehicles, even at high speed. Second, in addition to the edge system design, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) provides redundancy for autonomous driving workloads and alleviates stringent performance and energy constraints on the edge side. With V2X, more research is required to define how vehicles cooperate with each other and the infrastructure. Last, safety cannot be guaranteed when security is compromised. Thus, protecting autonomous driving edge computing systems against attacks at different layers of the sensing and computing stack is of paramount concern. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art approaches in these areas as well as explore potential solutions to address these challenges.

Abstract
	The Deployment of new techniques to accommodate high data throughput, significant reliability, and quality of service (QoS) delivery prompts the use of 4G and 5G networks in several applications. In these networks, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications authorised by device-to-device cellular links (D2D) have gained momentum because of their potential to improve road safety, efficiency, and convenience. This improvement is to be provided by different types of V2X communications, including Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P), Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I), and Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) communications. However, considering several limiting factors such as mobility and increasing number of vehicles, efficiency of using wireless resources is a challenging task. Indeed, different research works on V2X radio resource allocation have been studied and evaluated with respect to several criteria. In this study, a survey of recent works but in a different way synthesising radio resource allocation methods is presented. Resource allocation classification into different categories is proposed. This classification is related to three main factors. The first takes into account the selection mode factor. It highlights the use of different approaches in each of the centralised, distributed, and mixed modes. The second one takes into account the considered performance criteria, including capacity, priority, delay etc. The last one focuses on the methods and scenarios used to evaluate a resource allocation approach.

Abstract
	As modern vehicles are capable to connect to an [external infrastructure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/external-infrastructure "Learn more about external infrastructure from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication technologies mature, the necessity to secure communications becomes apparent. There is a very real risk that today's vehicles are subjected to cyber-attacks that target [vehicular communications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vehicular-communication "Learn more about vehicular communications from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). This paper proposes a three-layer framework (sensing, communication and control) through which automotive security threats can be better understood. The sensing layer is made up of vehicle dynamics and environmental sensors, which are vulnerable to eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing attacks. The communication layer is comprised of both in-vehicle and V2X communications and is susceptible to eavesdropping, spoofing, man-in-the-middle, and [sybil attacks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/sybil-attack "Learn more about sybil attacks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). At the top of the hierarchy is the control layer, which enables autonomous vehicular functionality, including the automation of a vehicle's speed, braking, and steering. Attacks targeting the sensing and communication layers can propagate upward and affect the functionality and can compromise the security of the control layer. This paper provides the state-of-the-art review on attacks and threats relevant to the communication layer and presents [countermeasures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/countermeasure "Learn more about countermeasures from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages").

Abstract
	Automated vehicle (AV) deployment can bring about transformational changes to transportation and society as a whole. The infrastructure owner-operators (IOOs), who own, maintain, and operate the infrastructure, have the opportunity to work jointly with the AV industry to provide safe and efficient operations. A key question for the IOOs is, “What transportation infrastructure improvements do AV manufacturers believe will facilitate and improve AV performance?” This study was designed to address this question through a comprehensive survey approach, including an online survey and follow-up interviews. A list of ten questions was discussed, covering the physical and digital infrastructure, infrastructure maintenance, standards and specifications, policy support, data sharing, and so forth. The researchers reached out to more than 60 entities who hold the AV testing permit in California. In total, 20 companies responded. They were from different sectors and well represented the AV industry. From the results of this study, it is concluded that the most important roadway characteristics that have the potential to benefit the automated driving system (ADS) are: (1) digital mapping and signage; (2) lane markings; (3) work zone and incident information; (4) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications; (5) actual traffic signals; (6) general signage; and (7) lighting. The digital features considered most critical to help accelerate ADS deployment include work zone and road closure information, traffic signal phase and timing, and traffic congestion. This study provides diverse voices and in-depth insights into topics that the AV industry and IOOs should engage in to advance AVs’ deployment.

Abstract
	In the last few years, increasing attention has been provided to research Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) communication systems. These V2P systems serve different purposes (safety or convenience) and cater to different Vulnerable Road User (VRU) groups. Also, these V2P systems employ different communication technologies, and use different mechanisms to interact with the users. An effective V2P system also needs to consider varying characteristics of different VRUs. These various elements may be considered as design parameters of the V2P system. In this paper, we discuss such elements and propose a design framework for the V2P system based on them. We also provide an extensive survey of existing V2P efforts for safety and convenience applications and their design considerations. We perform a case study that compares the different approaches of V2P safety system for different VRU groups under different pre-crash scenarios. Finally, we discuss a few technological challenges in integration of VRUs into V2X systems.

Abstract
	Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is introduced for [cellular networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cellular-network "Learn more about cellular networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") allowing User Equipments (UEs) to communicate directly in close physical proximity. In traditional cellular networks, time synchronization is performed by the network infrastructure equipment to address the challenges of coordinating independent clocks and tasks of UEs to communicate with each other. These challenges are more critical in D2D as the network has no central point to coordinate UEs. The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) reviewing synchronization standards and techniques for D2D-enabled cellular networks and (ii) discussing different scenarios and contemporary cellular network generations. We review the main signals, channels, and entities used by D2D-enabled cellular networks for synchronization procedures in different scenarios. Moreover, we focus on the synchronization in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). Finally, we conduct a literature study on effective proposed synchronization techniques in D2D and [vehicular communications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vehicular-communication "Learn more about vehicular communications from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") to highlight recent advances and provide future directions.

Abstract
	Autonomous vehicle is being developed for widespread deployment. Its reliability and safety are critically dependent on advanced wireless technologies, e.g., vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. The frontend of a V2X system needs an antenna module that enables the vehicle to reliably connect to all other networks. Designing V2X antenna is challenging due to the complex in-vehicle environment, trend for hidden antenna solution, long simulation time and need for omnidirectional coverage. In this article, we survey these challenges as well as existing V2X antenna solutions. In view of the drawbacks in the existing solutions, we propose an efficient design methodology for V2X antennas to provide the desired coverage. The method utilizes a simple geometrical model of the vehicle that captures the shadowing effects of the vehicle body to obtain candidate antenna locations that offer the best coverage via multi-antenna diversity. Hence, complex full-wave simulation can be avoided. The approach is validated through comprehensive full-wave simulations and pattern measurements on two car models. The results confirm that, at 5.9GHz, line-of-sight shadowing has more dominant effect on the received power than multipath propagation due to the car body. In cases of strong diffraction and surface waves, a simple rule-of-thumb can be devised to improve the accuracy of the method.

Abstract
	The transport sector is commonly subordinate to several issues, such as traffic congestion and accidents. Despite this, in recent years, it is also evolving with regard to cooperation between vehicles. The fundamental objective of this trend is to increase road safety, attempting to anticipate the circumstances of potential danger. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies strive to give communication models that can be employed by vehicles in different application contexts. The resulting infrastructure is an ad-hoc mesh network whose nodes are not only vehicles but also all mobile devices equipped with wireless modules. The interaction between the multiple connected entities consists of information exchange through the adoption of suitable communication protocols. The main aim of the review carried out in this paper is to examine and assess the most relevant systems, applications, and communication protocols that will distinguish the future road infrastructures used by vehicles. The results of the investigation reveal the real benefits that technological cooperation can involve in road safety.

Abstract
	In an effort to reach accident-free milestones or drastically reduce/eliminate road fatalities rates and traffic congestion and to create disruptive, transformational mobility systems and services, different parties (e.g., automakers, universities, governments, and road traffic regulators) have collaborated to research, develop, and test connected vehicle (CV) technologies. CVs create new data-rich environments and are considered key enablers for many applications and services that will make our roads safer, less congested, and more eco-friendly. A deeper understanding of the CV technologies will pave the way to avoid setbacks and will help in developing more innovative applications and breakthroughs. In the CV paradigm, vehicles become smarter by communicating with nearby vehicles, connected infrastructure, and the surroundings. This connectivity will be substantial to support different features and systems, such as adaptive routing, real-time navigation, and slow and near real-time infrastructure. Further examples include environmental sensing, advanced driver-assistance systems, automated driving systems, mobility on demand, and mobility as a service. This article provides a comprehensive review on CV technologies including fundamental challenges, state-of-the-art enabling technologies, innovative applications, and potential opportunities that can benefit automakers, customers, and businesses. The current standardization efforts of the forefront enabling technologies, such as Wi-Fi 6 and 5G-cellular technologies are also reviewed. Different challenges in terms of cooperative computation, privacy/security, and over-the-air updates are discussed. Safety and non-safety applications are described and possible future opportunities that CV technology brings to our life are also highlighted.

Abstract
	Cellular Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is evolving from a communication technology for safety messages towards a platform for advanced V2X services such as platooning and autonomous driving. The development of technical specifications for V2X communications is done across several task specification groups (TSGs) and working groups (WGs) within 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). In this paper, we focus on radio access network (RAN) aspects for direct communication between user equipments (UEs), which is known as sidelink (SL) communication. Resource allocation for SL communication can be performed in one of two modes. In the first mode, resource allocation is centralized in the network. In the second mode, resource allocation is performed in a distributed manner among UEs, where resource selection is performed at a transmitting UE, i.e., the transmitting UE determines time and frequency resources for a SL transmission without the assistance of a base station. In this paper, we review V2X evolution from 4G to 5G in 3GPP focusing on resource allocation aspects defined in Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and New Radio (NR) specifications, with particular attention given to the difference in design and performance of each. We highlight the key 3GPP standard developments on V2X resource allocation which includes enhanced resource reselection mechanisms and partial sensing schemes. It is observed that NR V2X resource reselection mechanism can provide up to 20% of reliability improvement over LTE V2X and NR V2X partial sensing scheme can provide up to 95% of reduced power consumption over full sensing scheme.

Abstract
	A wide variety of works have been conducted in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications to enable a variety of applications for road safety, traffic efficiency and passenger infotainment. Although dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) based V2X is already in the deployment phase, cellular based V2X is gaining more interest in academia and industry most recently. This article surveys the existing work and challenges on LTE and 5G to support efficient V2X communications. First, we present the motivations for cellular based V2X communications. Second, we summarize the LTE V2X architecture and operating scenarios being considered. Third, we discuss the challenges in existing LTE for supporting V2X communications such as physical layer structure, synchronization, multimedia broadcast multicast services (MBMS), resource allocation, security and survey the recent solutions to these challenges. We further discuss the challenges and possible solutions for 5G based vehicular communications. Finally, we discuss the open research issues and possible research directions in cellular based vehicular communications.

Abstract
	As the 2.4 GHz spectrum band has become significantly congested, there is growing interest from the Wi-Fi proponents, cellular operators, and other stakeholders to use the spectrum in the 5 GHz bands. The 5 GHz bands have emerged as the most coveted bands for launching new wireless applications and services, because of their relatively favorable propagation characteristics and the relative abundance of spectrum therein. To meet the exploding demand for more unlicensed spectrum, regulators across the world such as the United States Federal Communications Commission and the European Electronic Communications Committee have recently started considerations for opening up additional spectrum in the 5 GHz bands for use by unlicensed devices. Moreover, to boost cellular network capacity, wireless service providers are considering the deployment of unlicensed long term evaluation (LTE) in the 5 GHz bands. This and other emerging wireless technologies and applications have resulted in likely deployment scenarios where multiple licensed and unlicensed networks operate in overlapping spectrum. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the various coexistence scenarios in the 5 GHz bands. In this paper, we discuss coexistence issues between a number of important wireless technologies-viz., LTE and Wi-Fi, radar and Wi-Fi, dedicated short range communication (DSRC) and Wi-Fi, and coexistence among various 802.11 protocols operating in the 5 GHz bands. Additionally, we identify and provide brief discussions on an impending coexistence issue-one between Cellular V2X and DSRC/Wi-Fi. We summarize relevant standardization initiatives, explain existing coexistence solutions, and discuss open research problems.

Abstract
	With increasing connectivity, more and more advanced forms of cooperation among vehicles have become possible. Research has shown that vehicle-to-vehicle communication can improve road safety. However, more recent research advances regarding complex interactions such as cooperative maneuver negotiation have not yet gained much attention. Thus, in this survey, we analyze proposals for maneuver coordination protocols among automated vehicles. We include the communication, computation, and decision-making architectures commonly employed and a categorization scheme for different application-layer protocols enabling cooperative maneuvers. Next, we summarize related standardization, industry alliances, and research projects. As this field of research is still emerging, we also identify the diverse challenges that lie ahead before cooperative maneuver negotiations among automated vehicles can become a reality.

Abstract
	Future vehicles will be increasingly connected to enable new applications and improve safety, traffic efficiency and comfort, through the use of several wireless access technologies, ranging from vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity to automotive radar sensing and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for intra-car wireless sensor networks. These technologies span the radiofrequency (RF) range, from a few hundred MHz as in intra-car network of sensors to hundreds of GHz as in automotive radars used for in-vehicle occupant detection and advanced driver assistance systems. Vehicle occupants and road users in the vicinity of the connected vehicle are thus daily immersed in a multi-source and multi-band electromagnetic field (EMF) generated by such technologies. This paper is the first comprehensive and specific survey about EMF exposure generated by the whole ensemble of connectivity technologies in cars. For each technology we describe the main characteristics, relevant standards, the application domain, and the typical deployment in modern cars. We then extensively describe the EMF exposure scenarios resulting from such technologies by resuming and comparing the outcomes from past studies on the exposure in the car. Results from past studies suggested that in no case EMF exposure was above the safe limits for the general population. Finally, open challenges for a more realistic characterization of the EMF exposure scenario in the connected car are discussed.

Abstract
	By enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to share data while driving, 5G vehicular communications allow AVs to collaborate on solving common autonomous driving tasks. AVs often rely on machine learning models to perform such tasks; as such, collaboration requires leveraging vehicular communications to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. This paper provides a comprehensive literature survey of the intersection between machine learning for autonomous driving and vehicular communications. Throughout the paper, we explain how vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications are used to improve machine learning in AVs, answering five major questions regarding such systems. These questions include: 1) How can AVs effectively transmit data wirelessly on the road? 2) How do AVs manage the shared data? 3) How do AVs use shared data to improve their perception of the environment? 4) How do AVs use shared data to drive more safely and efficiently? and 5) How can AVs protect the privacy of shared data and prevent cyberattacks? We also summarize data sources that may support research in this area and discuss the future research potential surrounding these five questions.

Abstract
	The recent progress in autonomous vehicle research and development has led to increasingly widespread testing of fully autonomous vehicles on public roads, where complex traffic scenarios arise. Along with these vehicles, partially autonomous vehicles, manually-driven vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and some animals can be present on the road, to which autonomous vehicles must react. This study focuses on a comprehensive survey of the literature on motion prediction and state estimation of vehicles and VRUs, which are essential for path planning and navigation functionalities of an autonomous vehicle. Motion prediction and state estimation methods utilize the vehicle’s own sensory perception capabilities and information obtained through cooperative perception from V2V and V2X connections. This survey summarizes the significant progress that has been made in both categories, discusses the most promising results to date and outlines critical research challenges that need to be overcome to achieve full autonomy, from an ego vehicle’s perspective in mixed traffic environments.

Abstract
	With the significant development of practicability in deep learning and the ultra-high-speed information transmission rate of 5G communication technology will overcome the barrier of data transmission on the Internet of Vehicles, automated driving is becoming a pivotal technology affecting the future industry. Sensors are the key to the perception of the outside world in the automated driving system and whose cooperation performance directly determines the safety of automated driving vehicles. In this survey, we mainly discuss the different strategies of multi-sensor fusion in automated driving in recent years. The performance of conventional sensors and the necessity of multi-sensor fusion are analyzed, including radar, LiDAR, camera, ultrasonic, GPS, IMU, and V2X. According to the differences in the latest studies, we divide the fusion strategies into four categories and point out some shortcomings. Sensor fusion is mainly applied for multi-target tracking and environment reconstruction. We discuss the method of establishing a motion model and data association in multi-target tracking. At the end of the paper, we analyzed the deficiencies in the current studies and put forward some suggestions for further improvement in the future. Through this investigation, we hope to analyze the current situation of multi-sensor fusion in the automated driving process and provide more efficient and reliable fusion strategies.

Abstract
	Nowadays, with the advancement of technology, world is trending toward high mobility and dynamics. In this context, intersection management (IM) as one of the most crucial elements of the transportation sector demands high attention. Today, road entities including infrastructures, vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as motorcycles, moped, scooters, pedestrians, bicycles, and other types of vehicles such as trucks, buses, cars, emergency vehicles, and railway vehicles like trains or trams are able to communicate cooperatively using vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications and provide traffic safety, efficiency, infotainment and ecological improvements. In this paper, we take into account different types of intersections in terms of signalized, semi-autonomous (hybrid) and autonomous intersections and conduct a comprehensive survey on various intersection management methods for heterogeneous connected vehicles (CVs). We consider heterogeneous classes of vehicles such as road and rail vehicles as well as VRUs including bicycles, scooters and motorcycles. All kinds of intersection goals, modeling, coordination architectures, scheduling policies are thoroughly discussed. Signalized and semi-autonomous intersections are assessed with respect to these parameters. We especially focus on autonomous intersection management (AIM) and categorize this section based on four major goals involving safety, efficiency, infotainment and environment. Each intersection goal provides an in-depth investigation on the corresponding literature from the aforementioned perspectives. Moreover, robustness and resiliency of IM are explored from diverse points of view encompassing sensors, information management and sharing, planning universal scheme, heterogeneous collaboration, vehicle classification, quality measurement, external factors, intersection types, localization faults, communication anomalies and channel optimization, synchronization, vehicle dynamics and model mismatch, model uncertainties, recovery, security and privacy

Abstract
	For an autonomous vehicle to operate safely and effectively, an accurate and robust localization system is essential. While there are a variety of vehicle localization techniques in literature, there is a lack of effort in comparing these techniques and identifying their potentials and limitations for autonomous vehicle applications. Hence, this paper evaluates the state-of-the-art vehicle localization techniques and investigates their applicability on autonomous vehicles. The analysis starts with discussing the techniques which merely use the information obtained from on-board vehicle sensors. It is shown that although some techniques can achieve the accuracy required for autonomous driving but suffer from the high cost of the sensors and also sensor performance limitations in different driving scenarios (e.g., cornering and intersections) and different environmental conditions (e.g., darkness and snow). This paper continues the analysis with considering the techniques which benefit from off-board information obtained from V2X communication channels, in addition to vehicle sensory information. The analysis shows that augmenting off-board information to sensory information has potential to design low-cost localization systems with high accuracy and robustness, however, their performance depends on penetration rate of nearby connected vehicles or infrastructure and the quality of network service

Abstract
	Emerging [vehicular applications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vehicular-application "Learn more about vehicular applications from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") with strict latency and reliability requirements pose high computing requirements, and current vehicles’ computational resources are not adequate to meet these demands. In this scenario, vehicles can get help to process tasks from other resource-rich computing platforms, including nearby vehicles, fixed edge servers, and remote cloud servers. Nonetheless, different [vehicular communication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vehicular-communication "Learn more about vehicular communication from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") network (VCN) modes need to be utilized to access these computing resources, improving applications and networks’ performance and quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on the vehicular task offloading techniques under a communication perspective, i.e., vehicle to vehicle (V2V), vehicle to [roadside infrastructure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/roadside-infrastructure "Learn more about roadside infrastructure from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (V2I), and vehicle to everything (V2X). For the task/computation offloading, we present the classification of methods under the V2V, V2I, and V2X communication domains. Besides, the task/computation offloading categories are each sub-categorized according to their schemes’ objectives. Furthermore, the literature on vehicular task offloading is elaborated, compared, and analyzed from the perspectives of approaches, objectives, merits, demerits, etc. Finally, we highlight the open research challenges in this field and predict future research trends.

Abstract
	We are on the cusp of a new era of connected autonomous vehicles with unprecedented user experiences, tremendously improved road safety and air quality, highly diverse transportation environments and use cases, and a plethora of advanced applications. Realizing this grand vision requires a significantly enhanced vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network that should be extremely intelligent and capable of concurrently supporting hyperfast, ultrareliable, and low-latency massive information exchange. It is anticipated that the sixth-generation (6G) communication systems will fulfill these requirements of the next-generation V2X. In this article, we outline a series of key enabling technologies from a range of domains, such as new materials, algorithms, and system architectures. Aiming for truly intelligent transportation systems, we envision that machine learning (ML) will play an instrumental role in advanced vehicular communication and networking. To this end, we provide an overview of the recent advances of ML in 6G vehicular networks.

Abstract
	In this review paper, the state-of-the-art vehicle-to-everything (V2X) mode operation of electric vehicles (EVs) is discussed. All the other modes of operation which are enabled by the V2X functionality of the system like Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), Vehicle-for-Grid (V4G), Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Home (V2H), and Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) are discussed in detail. The V2X functionality is used to provide various services to the system like regulation of active power demand, reactive power compensation, shaving peaks and filling valleys in load demand, frequency and voltage regulation, compensation of harmonics in grid current. The techniques which are used to control the EV in V2X mode to impart the above-mentioned services are included. The advantages and limitations of these techniques are also discussed in this paper. The interaction among different modes of operation of EVs like V2G, V4G, V2V, V2H, and V2L is studied. Battery degradation, cyber-attacks, time-delays encountered in communication channels, and stability issues are the major challenges that may pose the threat to the resiliency of the V2X system. These dominant challenges are included in this paper. The methods which are used to enhance the resiliency of the V2X system against these issues are discussed as the scope of future work.

Abstract
	As vehicle complexity and road congestion increase, combined with the emergence of electric vehicles, the need for [intelligent transportation systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/intelligent-transportation-system "Learn more about intelligent transportation systems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") to improve on-road safety and transportation efficiency using vehicular networks has become essential. The evolution of high mobility wireless networks will provide improved support for connected vehicles through highly dynamic [heterogeneous networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/heterogeneous-network "Learn more about heterogeneous networks from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Particularly, 5G deployment introduces new features and technologies that enable operators to capitalize on emerging infrastructure capabilities. Machine Learning (ML), a powerful methodology for adaptive and predictive system development, has emerged in both vehicular and conventional wireless networks. Adopting data-centric methods enables ML to address highly dynamic vehicular network issues faced by conventional solutions, such as traditional control loop design and optimization techniques. This article provides a short survey of ML applications in vehicular networks from the networking aspect. Research topics covered in this article include network control containing [handover](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/handover "Learn more about handover from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") management and routing decision making, resource management, and energy efficiency in vehicular networks. The findings of this paper suggest more attention should be paid to network forming/deforming decision making. ML applications in vehicular networks should focus on researching multi-agent cooperated oriented methods and overall complexity reduction while utilizing enabling technologies, such as [mobile edge computing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/mobile-edge-computing "Learn more about mobile edge computing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") for real-world deployment. Research datasets, simulation environment standardization, and method interpretability also require more research attention.

Abstract
	With the rapid evolution in wireless communications and autonomous vehicles, intelligent and autonomous vehicles will be launched soon. Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communications provides driving safety, traffic efficiency, and road information in real-time in vehicular networks. V2X has evolved by integrating cellular 5G and New Radio (NR) access technology in V2X communications (i.e., 5G NR V2X); it can fulfill the ever-evolving vehicular application, communication, and service demands of connected vehicles, such as ultra-low latency, ultra-high bandwidth, ultra-high reliability, and security. However, with the increasing number of intelligent and autonomous vehicles and their safety requirements, there is a backlash in deployment and management because of scalability, poor security and less flexibility. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) plays a significant role in bringing cloud services closer to vehicular nodes, which reduces the scalability and flexibility issues. In addition, blockchain has evolved as an effective technology enabler to solve several security, privacy, and networking issues faced by the current 5G-based MEC systems in vehicular networks. Blockchain can be integrated as a strong security mechanism for securing and managing 5G V2X along with MEC. In this survey, we discuss, in detail, state-of-the-art V2X, its evolution based on cellular 5G technology and non-cellular 802.11bd. We investigate the integration of blockchain in 5G-based MEC vehicular networks for security, privacy protection, and content caching. We present the issues and challenges in existing edge computing and 5G V2X and, then, we shed some light on future research directions in these integrated and emerging technologies.

Abstract
	Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) creates many new opportunities in the area of wireless communications, while its feasibility on enabling vehicular positioning (VP) has not been fully explored despite its importance for autonomous driving. This article aims at investigating whether V2X can help VP from different perspectives. We first explain V2X's critical advantages over other technologies (e.g., GPS, RADAR, LIDAR, and camera) and suggest new scenarios of V2X-based VP. Then, we review the state-of-the-art positioning techniques discussed in different standardizations and point out their limitations. Lastly, some promising research directions for V2X-based VP are presented, which contribute to realizing fully autonomous driving by overcoming the current obstacles.

Abstract
	Radio access technologies, such as C-V2X and DSRC, have been used to support robust communication in connected vehicles scenarios. However, existing studies mostly dealt with homogenous vehicular networks, where coexistence of different radio access technologies in vehicles are not considered. More precisely, such multi-radio interface environments burden communications among vehicles. In this article, we first review DSRC and C-V2X radio access technologies and existing packet relaying mechanisms that are specifically designed for homogenous or heterogeneous vehicular environments. We then present a quality of service aware relaying algorithm (QR) that incorporates multi-metric to prioritize dual interface vehicles (DVs) and provides robust communications among vehicles that are equipped with different radio access technologies. The simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed QR in terms of message reception and relaying count as compared to the standard protocols.

Abstract
	The uptake of electric vehicles supports decarbonization and increasingly interconnects the electricity and transport system. While the integration of electric vehicles could challenge electricity grids, bidirectional power flows between vehicles and grids could support grid operations. Despite the globally increasing number of Vehicle-to-X trials, including Vehicle-to-Grid and Vehicle-to-Customer, an in-depth understanding of trial implementations and expert experiences has largely been overlooked although they are both crucial for technological development and deployment. Based on our analysis of a global Vehicle-to-X trial database and 47 interviews with experts from industry and academia, we (i) provide an overview of the implementation status of Vehicle-to-X and analyze predominate trial configurations, i.e. combinations of characteristics, (ii) identify important technical, social and regulatory challenges for the implementation of Vehicle-to-X and assess and discuss expert evaluations of these challenges and (iii) derive implications for different actors.
	The most predominate trial configurations are Vehicle-to-Customer and transmission-level services provided by commercial fleets that charge at work due to current practical advantages of centralized approaches. From a technical standpoint, we find that although Vehicle-to-X can defer or even mitigate grid reinforcement at the distribution level, this potential is highly dependent on local conditions. Regarding social aspects, incentives and Vehicle-to-X operations need to be tailored to different vehicle users. Concerning regulation, it is imperative to avoid double taxation of electricity, simplify market participation for small providers, and further develop Vehicle-to-X standards. Implications for actors include the evaluation and enablement of portfolios with different flexibility assets, and stacking of services to increase revenue streams and reduce risk resulting from variations in driving patterns and charging behavior.

Abstract
	Following the successful use of sidelink in Long Term Evolution (LTE) for Proximity Services (ProSe) and Cellular Vehicular-to-everything (C-V2X), the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is working towards its evolution in New Radio (NR) systems in the context of the so-called NR V2X. This new technology is expected to complement LTE C-V2X for advanced services by offering low latency, high reliability, and high throughput V2X services for advanced driving use cases. To do this, NR V2X is equipped with new features, such as the support for groupcast and unicast communication, a novel feedback channel, and a new control channel design. In this paper, we provide a complete history of sidelink technology in 3GPP followed by a detailed overview of NR V2X technology, with special emphasis on Mode 2 for out of coverage operation and autonomous resource selection. Furthermore, this paper presents a system-level NR V2X standard-compliant simulator, as an extension of the popular and open-source NR network simulator 5G-LENA, based on ns-3. In particular, we focus on the design, implementation, and evaluation of the sensing-based resource selection in NR V2X Mode 2, in a highway scenario. Through several and extensive simulation campaigns, we test the impact of different NR V2X parameters, such as the numerology, the resource selection window size, the number of retransmissions, the maximum number of resources per reservation, and the probability of keeping the same resources during reselection, in a sensing-based resource selection. Finally, we provide a comparison campaign that shows the gains attained by the sensing-based resource selection, proposed during 3GPP Release 16, over the random selection strategy, considered in 3GPP Release 17 for power saving purposes.

Abstract
	Recently, the telecommunication standard development body reported LTE support for V2X services-based use cases along with their potential requirements. However, these requirements overlap and require a huge effort to understand. Therefore, it is imperative to know the outcomes of the use cases and categorization of the potential requirements. In this paper, we provided an overview of the use cases, their potential outcomes, and a comparison between the potential requirements based on their categorization i.e. latency, message size, mobility performance, response time, message frequency, anonymity and integrity, reliability, and communication. The outcomes help in knowing about the response envisioned by the identified use cases for V2X services. The comparison of potential requirements describes three important requirements: latency, message size, and mobility performance for realizing the V2X service-based use cases. In future work, we aim to provide a holistic overview of realizing enhanced use cases in real-world scenarios to accomplish V2X service communication.

Abstract
	C-V2X aims at resolving issues pertaining to the traditional usability of V2I and V2V networking. Specifically, C-V2X lowers the number of entities involved in vehicular communications and allows the inclusion of cellular-security solutions to be applied to V2X. For this, the evolvement of LTE-V2X is revolutionary, but it fails to handle the demands of high throughput, ultrahigh reliability, and ultra-low latency alongside its security mechanisms. To counter this, 5G-V2X is considered as an integral solution, which not only resolves the issues related to LTE-V2X but also provides a function-based network setup. Several reports have been given for the security of 5G, but none of them primarily focuses on the security of 5G-V2X and its supportive mobile backhaul. This article provides a detailed overview of 5G-V2X with a security-based comparison to LTE-V2X. A novel Security Reflex Function (SRF)-based architecture is proposed and several research challenges are presented related to the security of 5G-V2X. Furthermore, the article lays out requirements of Ultra-Dense and Ultra-Secure (UD-US) transmissions necessary for 5G-V2X.

Abstract
	Modern vehicles rely on data from a vast array of sensors such as radar and GPS equipment that can be shared with surrounding vehicles and other interested parties. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is the collection of systems that enable such communication. Although this data sharing has the potential to improve both the safety and efficiency of vehicles, ensuring that what is shared has not been altered, deleted, forged, leaked, or otherwise tampered with remains a challenging problem. Today, blockchain technology allows a system’s participants to come to an agreement (consensus) on the state of the system and its data in a decentralized, trustless manner. This new technology may be capable of securing V2X data, as well as enabling other useful V2X services such as payments. However, the V2X ecosystem poses several unique challenges that complicate the application of blockchain technology, not least of which is the vast number of communications that any proposed blockchain network will need to support. This paper gives an overview of V2X and blockchain technology, explores potential applications of blockchain within the V2X domain, and justifies its importance. It also reviews, analyzes, and discusses various blockchain architectures that could support V2X applications. Though there is a place for blockchain in the V2X environment, currently there is no robust or mature blockchain architecture available that could support the entire ecosystem’s needs. As such, this paper proposes novel directions for future research towards the creation of such a blockchain.

Abstract
	Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication is a powerful concept that not only ensures public safety (e.g., by avoiding road accidents) but also offers many economic benefits (e.g., by optimizing the macroscopic behavior of the traffic across an area). On the one hand, V2X communication brings new business opportunities for many stakeholders, such as vehicle manufacturers, retailers, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), V2X service providers, and governments. On the other hand, the convergence of these stakeholders to a common platform possesses many technical and business challenges. In this article, we identify the issues and challenges faced by V2X communications, while focusing on the business models. We propose different solutions to potentially resolve the identified challenges in the framework of 5G networks and propose a high-level hierarchy of a potential business model for a 5G-based V2X ecosystem. Moreover, we provide a concise overview of the legislative status of V2X communications across different regions in the world.

Abstract
	Vehicle-to-everything (V2X), including vehicle- to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-network (V2N) communications, improves road safety, traffic efficiency, and the availability of infotainment services. Standardization of Long Term Evolution (LTE)-based V2X has been actively conducted by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to provide solutions for V2X communications, and has benefited from the global deployment and fast commercialization of LTE systems. LTE-based V2X was widely used as LTE-V in the Chinese vehicular communications industry, and LTE-based V2X was redefined as LTE V2X in 3GPP standardization progress. In this article, the overview of requirements and use cases in V2X services in 3GPP is presented. The up-to-date standardization of LTE V2X in 3GPP is surveyed. The challenges and detailed design aspects in LTE V2X are also discussed. Meanwhile, the enhanced V2X (eV2X) services and possible 5G solutions are analyzed. Finally, the implementations of LTE V2X are presented with the latest progress in industrial alliances, research, development of prototypes, and field tests.

Abstract
	Following the success story of passive and autonomous active safety systems, cooperative [Intelligent Transportation Systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/intelligent-transportation-system "Learn more about Intelligent Transportation Systems from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") based on [vehicular communication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vehicular-communication "Learn more about vehicular communication from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") are the next important step to the vision of accident-free driving. In recent years, various research projects have contributed solutions for the fundamental technological requirements of vehicle communication. Cost-efficient positioning and radio hardware is available and standardization is underway. Today, the focus of the work on vehicular communication shifts from research topics to preparing deployment. This is also reflected in the fact that publicly funded projects in all regions of the world move from clearly targeted research activities to the integrative measure of field operational tests. In this paper, we give an overview of how research on vehicular communication evolved in Europe and, especially, in Germany. We then describe the German field operational test simTD. The project simTD is the first field operational test to evaluate the effectiveness and benefits of applications based on vehicular communication in a setup that is representative for a realistic [deployment environment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/deployment-environment "Learn more about deployment environment from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). It is, therefore, the next necessary step to prepare for an informed deployment decision of cooperative systems.

Abstract
	Identification of ecosystems and Business Models (BM) is an important starting point for new complex system development. The definition of actor (or stakeholder) roles and their interactions (at both business and technical levels), together with target scenarios and use cases, provide essential input information for further system requirement collection and architecture specification. The powerful and flexible Fifth Generation (5G) network slicing technology, which is capable of creating virtually isolated and logically parallel networks, enables a large range of complex services and vertical applications. Although various terminologies and models have been proposed in recent years for BMs in the 5G domain by many studies, projects, standards, and technical specifications from dedicated organizations, they are not always consistent with each other. This study presents an overview and comparison of different BMs for 5G sliced systems, followed by an example on BM definition for a 5G system in a novel ongoing European research project. While a general ecosystem and business model could involve a large range of organizations (including, e.g., regulation and standardization bodies), the scope of this article will be limited to primarily 5G operational BMs, with a focus on those actors or stakeholders who are active and interacting during real-life system operation. Within the project, we perform a selection among some tailored BM configurations, adapted for dedicated slices with different service requirements, aiming to serve Vehicle to Everything (V2X) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications as well as Internet of Things (IoT) for maritime vertical applications. The final part of this article presents our proposed IoT connectivity solutions for various maritime scenarios with and without involving satellite links. Furthermore, we shed light on future challenges and directions for network slicing in beyond 5G systems.

Abstract
	The concept of direct communications between vehicles and to/from vehicles and roadside infrastructure (vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure – V2X) has been around for more than 20 years. With the specification of direct communication in the 3GPP, a new V2X technology has emerged with the global telecommunications specification efforts. This technology, formally known as PC5 Sidelink, but commonly called LTE-V2X (or sometimes C-V2X) is initially based on Release 14 of 3GPP, enabling those long-envisioned use cases to be delivered with a different, mainstreamed radio access technology. This paper summarizes how LTE-V2X works, describes the standard activities in different layers of LTE-V2X protocol stack for US deployment, and showcases the performance of LTE-V2X in variety of real-world driving scenarios.

Abstract
	GSM-R is predicted to be obsoletd by 2030, and a suitable successor is needed. Defined by the International Union of Railways, the Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS) contains many future use cases with strict requirements. These use cases should ensure regular communication not only in network coverage but also in uncovered scenarios. There is still a lack of standards on off-network communication in FRMCS, so this article focuses on off-network communication and intends to provide reference and direction for standardization. We first provide a comprehensive summary and analysis of off-network use cases in FRMCS. Then we give an overview of existing technologies (GSM-R, TETRA, DMR, LTE-V2X, and NR-V2X) that may support off-network communication. In addition, we simulate and evaluate the performance of existing technologies. Simulation results show that it is possible to satisfy the off-network communication requirements in FRMCS with enhancements based on LTE-V2X or NR-V2X. Finally, we give some future research directions to provide insights for industry and academia.

Abstract
	Vehicular cloud computing (VCC) is an improvement from conventional cloud computing to new revolutionized computing services including intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and vehicle control, Internet browsing, online documentation, and infotainment. It enables vehicles to autonomously share heterogeneous computational resources while solving unanticipated critical problems dynamically. However, in a world of black hats, technology often has a dark side as well. Therefore, the VCC is limited by considerable security and privacy challenges. The special characteristics of VCC, including the multitenancy nature of clouds, intermittent wireless communications, high mobility of vehicles, and rapid resource elasticity with decentralized operations, have promoted security solutions used in vehicular ad hoc networks and conventional cloud computing to be revised. This paper first presents a state-of-the-art study of VCC that focuses on VCC architecture, its features analysis, and extensive VCC applications. Second, the proposed threats identification taxonomy and an exhaustive survey on security and privacy issues in VCC are presented under a layered approach: physical resource layer, vehicle-to-anything (V2X) network layer, and vehicular cloud layer, as well as at a complete system level. Finally, we highlight and discuss challenges and open research issues that can be considered as future research directions.

Abstract
	The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has recently published its Release 16 that includes the first Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) standard based on the 5G New Radio (NR) air interface. 5G NR V2X introduces advanced functionalities on top of the 5G NR air interface to support connected and automated driving use cases with stringent requirements. This article presents an in-depth tutorial of the 3GPP Release 16 5G NR V2X standard for V2X communications, with a particular focus on the sidelink, since it is the most significant part of 5G NR V2X. The main part of the paper is an in-depth treatment of the key aspects of 5G NR V2X: the physical layer, the resource allocation, the quality of service management, the enhancements introduced to the Uu interface and the mobility management for V2N (Vehicle to Network) communications, as well as the co-existence mechanisms between 5G NR V2X and LTE V2X. We also review the use cases, the system architecture, and describe the evaluation methodology and simulation assumptions for 5G NR V2X. Finally, we provide an outlook on possible 5G NR V2X enhancements, including those identified within Release 17.

Abstract
	Bidirectional DC–DC converters are frequently chosen for applications requiring high power density such as in bidirectional electric vehicle (EV) chargers. Vehicle to Everything (V2X) technology makes the EV battery an electrical energy source. In this article, the use of a DC–DC LLC converter used in a bidirectional EV charger is reviewed. Different modeling approaches of the DC–DC LLC converter, such as small and large signal modeling, are discussed. Common modulation strategies applied to the DC–DC LLC converter in V2X mode, such as Pulse Frequency Modulation (PFM), Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and Phase-Shift Modulation (PSM), are presented. The new challenge is to present the main characteristics and limitations of each modulation strategy in order to cover the whole operating zone of the EV charger in V2X mode. Furthermore, different control strategies based on a small or large signal model combined with different modulation strategies are highlighted. Linear and nonlinear controllers applied to the DC–DC LLC converter are discussed. Robust controllers are mainly highlighted regarding their advantage in ensuring the control robustness with respect to unexpected disturbances. A comparative study among modulation strategies as well as different control algorithms is conducted in terms of control performance and converter efficiency in V2X mode.

Abstract
	Fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks fulfill the demands of critical applications, such as Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC), particularly in the automotive industry. Vehicular communication requires low latency and high computational capabilities at the network’s edge. To meet these requirements, ETSI standardized Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), which provides cloud computing capabilities and addresses the need for low latency. This paper presents a generalized overview for implementing a 5G-MEC testbed for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications, as well as the analysis of some important testbeds and state-of-the-art implementations based on their deployment scenario, 5G use cases, and open source accessibility. The complexity of using the testbeds is also discussed, and the challenges researchers may face while replicating and deploying them are highlighted. Finally, the paper summarizes the tools used to build the testbeds and addresses open issues related to implementing the testbeds.

Abstract
	The application of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology has resulted in the traffic environment being different from how it was in the past. In the V2X environment, the information perception ability of the driver–vehicle unit is greatly enhanced. With V2X technology, the driver–vehicle unit can obtain a massive amount of traffic information and is able to form a connection and interaction relationship between multiple vehicles and themselves. In the traditional car-following models, only the dual-vehicle interaction relationship between the object vehicle and its preceding vehicle was considered, making these models unable to be employed to describe the car-following behavior in the V2X environment. As one of the core components of traffic flow theory, research on car-following behavior needs to be further developed. First, the development process of the traditional car-following models is briefly reviewed. Second, previous research on the impacts of V2X technology, car-following models in the V2X environment, and the applications of these models, such as the calibration of the model parameters, the analysis of traffic flow characteristics, and the methods that are used to estimate a vehicle’s energy consumption and emissions, are comprehensively reviewed. Finally, the achievements and shortcomings of these studies along with trends that require further exploration are discussed. The results that were determined here can provide a reference for the further development of traffic flow theory, personalized advanced driving assistance systems, and anthropopathic autonomous-driving vehicles.

Abstract
	With the development and progress of information technology, especially V2X technology, the research focus of intelligent vehicles gradually shifted from single-vehicle control to multi-vehicle control, and the cooperative control system of intelligent connected vehicles became an important topic of development. In order to track the research progress of intelligent connected vehicle cooperative driving systems in recent years, this paper discusses the current research of intelligent connected vehicle cooperative driving systems with vehicles, infrastructure, and test sites, and analyzes the current development status, development trend, and development limitations of each object. Based on the analysis results of relevant references of the cooperative control algorithm, this paper expounds on vehicle collaborative queue control, vehicle collaborative decision making, and vehicle collaborative positioning. In the case of taking the infrastructure as the object, this paper expounds the communication security, communication delay, and communication optimization algorithm of the vehicle terminal and the road terminal of intelligent connected vehicles. In the case of taking the test site as the object, this paper expounds the development process and research status of the real vehicle road test platform, virtual test platform, test method, and evaluation mechanism, and analyzes the problems existing in the intelligent connected vehicle test environment. Finally, the future development trend and limitations of intelligent networked vehicle collaborative control system are discussed. This paper summarizes the intelligent connected car collaborative control system, and puts forward the next problems to be solved and the direction of further exploration. The research results can provide a reference for the cooperative driving of intelligent vehicles.

Abstract
	The intelligent transport system (ITS) has become one of the most globally researched topics with a lot of investment and development resources being dedicated into it due to its foreseen impact on the economic growth of the transport sector. Currently there are two main vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies, whose primary application is focused on ITS, backed up by the key players of various automotive, telecommunication and transport industries: dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) and cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), respectively based on IEEE 802.11p and 3GPP LTE/5G NR. While DSRC already has deployments, C-V2X is expected to see larger scale trails and deployments in 2020. In this work, the authors provide insight and review into two main V2X technologies, DSRC and C-V2X, their core parameters, shortcomings and limitations, and explore the need for integration of IoT-based technologies into modern ITS solutions. A comprehensive overview and analysis of currently commercially available V2X products, their sub-blocks and features is provided.

Abstract
	C-V2X (Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything) is a state-of-the-art wireless technology used in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). This technology has extended the coverage and blind-spot detection of autonomous driving vehicles. Economically, C-V2X is much more cost-effective than the traditional sensors that are commonly used by autonomous driving vehicles. This cost-benefit makes it more practical in a large scale deployment. PC5-based C-V2X uses an RF (Radio Frequency) sidelink direct communication for low latency mission-critical vehicle sensor connectivity. Over the C-V2X radio communications, the autonomous driving vehicle’s sensor ability can now be largely enhanced to the distances as far as the network covers. In 2020, 5G is commercialized worldwide, and Taiwan is at the forefront. Operators and governments are keen to see its implications in people’s daily life brought by its low latency, high reliability, and high throughput. Autonomous driving class L3 (Conditional Automation) or L4 (Highly Automation) are good examples of 5G’s advanced applications. In these applications, the mobile networks with URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication) are perfectly demonstrated. Therefore, C-V2X evolution and 5G NR (New Radio) deployment coincide and form a new ecosystem. This ecosystem will change how people will drive and how transportation will be managed in the future. In this paper, the following topics are covered. Firstly, the benefits of C-V2X communication technology. Secondly, the standards of C-V2X and C-V2X applications for automotive road safety system which includes V2P/V2I/V2V/V2N, and artificial intelligence in VRU (Vulnerable Road User) detection, object recognition and movement prediction for collision warning and prevention. Thirdly, PC5-based C-V2X deployment status in global, especially in Taiwan. Lastly, current challenges and conclusions of C-V2X development.

Abstract
	Platooning is an application where a group of vehicles move one after each other in [close proximity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/close-proximity "Learn more about close proximity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), acting jointly as a single physical system. The scope of platooning is to improve safety, reduce fuel consumption, and increase road use efficiency. Even if conceived several decades ago as a concept, based on the new progress in automation and [vehicular networking](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vehicular-networking "Learn more about vehicular networking from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") platooning has attracted particular attention in the latest years and is expected to become of common implementation in the next future, at least for trucks.
	The platoon system is the result of a combination of multiple disciplines, from transportation, to automation, to [electronics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/electronics "Learn more about electronics from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), to telecommunications. In this survey, we consider the platooning, and more specifically the platooning of trucks, from the point of view of [wireless communications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/wireless-communication "Learn more about wireless communications from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Wireless communications are indeed a key element, since they allow the information to propagate within the convoy with an almost negligible delay and really making all vehicles acting as one. Scope of this paper is to present a comprehensive survey on connected vehicles for the platooning application, starting with an overview of the projects that are driving the development of this technology, followed by a brief overview of the current and upcoming vehicular networking architecture and standards, by a review of the main open issues related to wireless communications applied to platooning, and a discussion of security threats and privacy concerns. The survey will conclude with a discussion of the main areas that we consider still open and that can drive future research directions.

Abstract
	Advances in technology are not only changing the world around us but also driving the wireless industry to develop the next generation of network technology. There is a lot of buzz building over the advent of 5G that will facilitate the entire planet through continuous and ubiquitous communication connecting anybody to anything, anywhere, anytime, and anyhow regardless of the device, service, network, or geographical existence. 5G will also prove to be a paradigm shift including high carrier frequencies with massive bandwidths, having a large number of antennas, and with an extreme base station and device densities. In this paper, we investigate the potential beneficiaries of 5G and identify the use-cases, where 5G can make an impact. In particular, we consider three main use-cases: vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, drones, and healthcare. We explore and highlight the problems and deficiencies of current cellular technologies with respect to these use-cases and identify how 5G will overcome those deficiencies. We also identified the open research problems and provide possible future directions to cope with those issues.

Abstract
	Nowadays, advanced communication technologies are being utilized to develop intelligent transportation management and driving assistance. Through the ability to exchange traffic and infotainment information between road infrastructure and vehicles, vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) promise to improve transport efficiency, accident prevention, and pedestrians comfort. The deployment of VANETs in the real world is based on the message’s correctness and timely delivery and assuredness of privacy protection and data security. In this regard, many researchers have conducted surveys and studies that present models and solutions related to the improvement of VANET from different aspects such as architectural design, networking, and data security. Motivated by these influences, this study presents a detailed survey of VANETs to provide a complete picture of particular VANET applications, networking, and challenges. None of them collected all data in one survey. VANET communication techniques and their improvements are the focus of this study. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, a complete taxonomy of VANET wireless access techniques has been provided based on various parameters. Second, a detailed discussion and classification VANET services and applications are provided. Third, the challenges related to VANET according to the applicability area, data networking, and resource management are explored in detail. Based on this classification, a complete description of the challenges for each category, including the proposed solutions and development models, is provided to overcome such challenges. Finally, the integration of evolutionary technologies with VANET is comprehensively presented. In this regard, a thorough explanation is provided for each technology, including the challenges, solutions, and suggestions for further improvements. This study enables various users working in the vehicular networking domain to select one of the proposals based on its relative advantages.

Abstract
	This paper summarizes the state of the art in connected vehicles-from the need for vehicle data and applications thereof, to enabling technologies, challenges, and identified opportunities. Connectivity is increasing around the world and its expansion to vehicles is no exception. With improvements in connectivity, sensing, and computation, the future will see vehicles used as development platforms capable of generating rich data, acting based on inference, and effecting great change in transportation, the human-vehicle dynamic, the environment, and the economy. Connected vehicle technologies have already been used to improve fleet safety and efficiency, with emerging technologies additionally allowing data to be used to inform aspects of vehicle design, ownership, and use. While the demand for connected vehicles and its enabling technology has progressed significantly in recent years, there remain challenges to connected and collaborative vehicle application deployment before the full potential of connected cars may be realized. From extensibility and scalability to privacy and security, this paper informs the reader about key enabling technologies, opportunities, and challenges in the connected vehicle landscape.

Abstract
	This article provides an overview of the long-term evolution-vehicle (LTE-V) standard supporting sidelink or vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications using LTE's direct interface named PC5 in LTE. We review the physical layer changes introduced under Release 14 for LTE-V, its communication modes 3 and 4, and the LTE-V evolutions under discussion in Release 15 to support fifth-generation (5G) vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications and autonomous vehicles' applications. Modes 3 and 4 support direct V2V communications but differ on how they allocate the radio resources. Resources are allocated by the cellular network under mode 3. Mode 4 does not require cellular coverage, and vehicles autonomously select their radio resources using a distributed scheduling scheme supported by congestion control mechanisms. Mode 4 is considered the baseline mode and represents an alternative to 802.11p or dedicated shortrange communications (DSRC). In this context, this article also presents a detailed analysis of the performance of LTE-V sidelink mode 4, and proposes a modification to its distributed scheduling.

Abstract
	With the promising advances in the telecommunication and automotive industries, there are increasing concerns on the reliability of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications and standardization efforts. Nowadays, vehicles are empowered with innovative communications and sensing capabilities to accelerate next-generation Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) or Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. Furthermore, V2X is based on many radio access technologies including Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC), Cellular-V2X, and millimeter-wave. It is expected that a single technology is incapable to support the diverse QoS and reliability requirements of vehicular safety and non-safety applications. Therefore, recent research works have investigated and developed different approaches to enable multi-radio access technologies (Multi-RAT) in V2X networks to support these multitudes of requirements. In addition, the heterogeneity of diverse radio access technologies and rigidity in their deployment increases the complexity of the network management. Complications may also arise from inefficient resource utilization due to the complexity of an optimum RAT selection or multi-link establishment through Multi-RATs. Therefore, a global monitoring paradigm such as Software-Defined Vehicular Network (SDVN) has been identified as a solution to reduce this bottleneck, by adding flexibility and agility to the vehicular network. This paper extensively reviews recent related works on Multi-RAT V2X networks focusing on the opportunistic selection mechanism of RAT, allocation of radio resources, and simultaneous establishment of multi-link over a heterogeneous network. Consequently, we have outlined the SDVN architecture, layers, features, and significance towards enhancing the performance of such Multi-RAT networks. Finally, several potential challenges with probable solutions and opportunities are discussed.

Abstract
	Safety-critical applications in cooperative vehicular networks require authentication of nodes and messages. Yet, privacy of individual vehicles and drivers must be maintained. Pseudonymity can satisfy both security and privacy requirements. Thus, a large body of work emerged in recent years, proposing pseudonym solutions tailored to vehicular networks. In this survey, we detail the challenges and requirements for such pseudonym mechanisms, propose an abstract pseudonym lifecycle, and give an extensive overview and categorization of the state of the art in this research area. Specifically, this survey covers pseudonym schemes based on public key and identity-based cryptography, group signatures and symmetric authentication. We compare the different approaches, give an overview of the current state of standardization, and identify open research challenges.

Abstract
	The fifth generation (5G) wireless communication networks are being deployed worldwide from 2020 and more capabilities are in the process of being standardized, such as mass connectivity, ultra-reliability, and guaranteed low latency. However, 5G will not meet all requirements of the future in 2030 and beyond, and sixth generation (6G) wireless communication networks are expected to provide global coverage, enhanced spectral/energy/cost efficiency, better intelligence level and security, etc. To meet these requirements, 6G networks will rely on new enabling technologies, i.e., air interface and transmission technologies and novel network architecture, such as waveform design, multiple access, channel coding schemes, multi-antenna technologies, network slicing, cell-free architecture, and cloud/fog/edge computing. Our vision on 6G is that it will have four new paradigm shifts. First, to satisfy the requirement of global coverage, 6G will not be limited to terrestrial communication networks, which will need to be complemented with non-terrestrial networks such as satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks, thus achieving a space-air-ground-sea integrated communication network. Second, all spectra will be fully explored to further increase data rates and connection density, including the sub-6 GHz, millimeter wave (mmWave), terahertz (THz), and optical frequency bands. Third, facing the big datasets generated by the use of extremely heterogeneous networks, diverse communication scenarios, large numbers of antennas, wide bandwidths, and new service requirements, 6G networks will enable a new range of smart applications with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies. Fourth, network security will have to be strengthened when developing 6G networks. This article provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances and future trends in these four aspects. Clearly, 6G with additional technical requirements beyond those of 5G will enable faster and further communications to the extent that the boundary between physical and cyber worlds disappears.

Abstract
	With the high demand for advanced services and the increase in the number of connected devices, current wireless communication systems are required to expand to meet the users’ needs in terms of quality of service, throughput, latency, connectivity, and security. 5G, 6G, and Beyond (xG) aim at bringing new radical changes to shake the wireless communication networks where everything will be fully connected fulfilling the requirements of ubiquitous connectivity over the wireless networks. This rapid revolution will transform the world of communication with more intelligent and sophisticated services and devices leading to new technologies operating over very high frequencies and broader bands. To achieve the objectives of the xG networks, several key technology enablers need to be performed, including massive MIMO, software-defined networking, network function virtualization, vehicular to everything, mobile edge computing, network slicing, terahertz, visible light communication, virtualization of the network infrastructure, and intelligent communication environment. In this paper, we investigated the recent advancements in the 5G/6G and Beyond systems. We highlighted and analyzed their different key technology enablers and use cases. We also discussed potential issues and future challenges facing the new wireless networks.

Abstract
	The most well-known research on driverless vehicles at the moment is connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), which reflects the future path for the self driving field. The development of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is not only increasing logistics operations, but it is also opening up new possibilities for the industry’s sustainable growth. In this review, we will explore the cloud-controlled wireless network-based model of cyber physical aspect of the autonomous vehicle, which is coupled with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Additionally, this model is Internet of Things (IoT) managed and AI-based, with a blockchain-based security mechanism. Additionally, we’ll focus on lateral control in autonomous driving, particularly the lane change maneuver, taking social behavior into account. Here, we briefly reviewed Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, which is carried out by on-board sensors and connected wireless medium that enhance the lane departure processes while retaining human driver behavior relying on obstacle avoidance.

Abstract
	Vehicular applications and communications technologies are often referred to as vehicle-to-everything (V2X), which is classified into four different types: vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle- to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-network (V2N), and vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) [1]. V2X related research projects, field tests, and regulatory work have been promoted in different countries and regions. In May 2015, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) of China explained national strategies, "Made in China 2025," about intelligent connected vehicles. In 2020 and 2025, the overall technology and key technologies for intelligent driver assistance and automatic driving will be available in China, respectively [2]. V2X solutions are the critical technologies to support the realization of such visions. Although IEEE 802.11p has been selected as the technology for V2X communications in some countries such as the United States and in Europe, the intrinsic characteristics of IEEE 802.11p have confined the technology to support low latency with high reliability [3, 4]. Standardization of Long Term Evolution (LTE)-based V2X is being actively conducted by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to provide the solution for V2X communications that benefit from the global deployment and fast commercialization of LTE systems. Because of the wide deployment of LTE networks, V2I and V2N services can be provided with high data rate, comprehensive quality of service (QoS) support, ubiquitous coverage, and high penetration rate [5]. Meanwhile, LTE can be extended to support V2V direct communications based on device-to-device (D2D) sidelink design to satisfy the QoS requirements, such as low latency, high reliability, and high speed in the case of high vehicle density [6].

Abstract
	A smart city is an urban area that collects data using various electronic methods and sensors. Smart cities rely on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and aim to improve the quality of services by managing public resources and focusing on comfort, maintenance, and sustainability. The fifth generation (5G) of wireless mobile communication enables a new kind of communication network to connect everyone and everything. 5G will profoundly impact economies and societies as it will provide the necessary communication infrastructure required by various smart city applications. Intelligent Transporting System (ITS) is one of the many smart city applications that can be realized via 5G technology. The paper aims to discuss the impact and implications of 5G on ITS from various dimensions. Before this, the paper presents an overview of the technological context and the economic benefits of the 5G and how key vertical industries will be affected in a smart city, i.e., energy, healthcare, manufacturing, entertainment, and automotive and public transport. Afterward, 5G for ITS is introduced in more detail.

Abstract
	Recently, electric vehicles (EVs) have been introduced as an alternative method of transportation to help mitigate environmental issues, such as carbon emissions and fuel consumption, caused by conventional transportation systems. The implementation of effective EV charging systems is essential to motivate mass adoption of EVs. Accordingly, fast and reliable communications between the charging systems and the EVs are vital for efficient management of the charging process. Different radio access technologies (RATs) are discussed in the literature to enable communication between the highly mobile EVs and the charging subsystems, to collect and exchange information such as state of charge (SoC), users’ locations, and charging decisions between the different network entities. This information can be used to coordinate charging plans and select the optimal routes for moving vehicles. This paper presents a survey of existing literature on vehicular communications for EV charging coordination and management. The communication requirements and feasible communication technologies for vehicular communication are first discussed in details. A review of the physical layer security strategies is then presented and the role of the different RATs in EV charging coordination and management is described and studied.
